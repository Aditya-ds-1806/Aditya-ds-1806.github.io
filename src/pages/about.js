          <SectionDescription>
            I&#39;m an aspiring software developer based in India. I have been
            developing full stack web, mobile and desktop applications in
            Node.js, React, MongoDB, Electron and other cool frameworks since
            the past 3 years.
            <br />
            <br />I developed a deep interest in <strong>Chess</strong> during
            the lockdown of 2020 and since then I have been playing and
            following the game very closely. I am also an amateur{' '}
            <strong>Carnatic Flutist</strong> and was first introduced to the
            instrument back in 2014. Recently, I rediscovered my interest in{' '}
            <strong>Astronomy</strong> and very soon I will begin stargazing!
