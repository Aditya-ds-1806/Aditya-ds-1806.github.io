Aditya's personal website running on Gatsby, React, and Node.js.

## ðŸš€ Get Up and Running

You can get a site up and running on your local dev environment in 5 minutes with these three steps:

1. **Install Dependencies and start the site in develop mode.**

   ```shell
   cd Aditya-ds-1806.github.io
   npm install
   gatsby develop
   ```

2. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`. Open the `Aditya-ds-1806.github.io` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes, and the browser will update in real time!

At this point, youâ€™ve got a fully functional website. For additional information on how you can customize your Gatsby site, see our [plugins](https://gatsbyjs.com/plugins/) and [the official tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/).
