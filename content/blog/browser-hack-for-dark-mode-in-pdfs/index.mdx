Dear dark mode lovers,

In this article I present a hack to view PDFs in dark mode on any browser! ðŸ”¥

To get started, open any PDF in your favorite browser. Then open the dev tools by using the shortcut <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> or <kbd>f12</kbd> and run one of the following in the *console* based on your browser:

## New Microsoft Edge/Google Chrome/Brave/Opera
```js
document.embeds[0].style.filter = 'invert(0.95)';
```

## Firefox
```js
document.getElementById('viewerContainer').style.filter = 'invert(0.95)';
```

This is the original image:

Here is the result after running the script:
![Dark Mode](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/3x7zsmjh5eq5ax0hka4u.png)

ðŸ’¡ You can change 0.95 to any number between 0 and 1.
